## Introduction

Fumadocs <span className='text-fd-muted-foreground text-sm'>(Foo-ma docs)</span> is a **documentation framework** based on Next.js, designed to be fast and flexible.
It composes seamlessly into Next.js App Router, allowing a high flexibility with code.

Fumadocs has different parts:

### Terminology

**Markdown/MDX:** Markdown is a markup language for creating formatted text. Fumadocs supports Markdown and MDX (superset of Markdown) out-of-the-box.

Some basic knowledge of Next.js App Router would be useful for further customisations.

## Automatic Installation

Create a new app with `create-fumadocs-app`.

Node.js 18 or above required, note that Node.js 23.1 might have problems with Next.js production build.


```bash
npm create fumadocs-app
```

```bash
pnpm create fumadocs-app
```

```bash
yarn create fumadocs-app
```

```bash
bun create fumadocs-app
```


It will initialize a new fumadocs app.
Now you can start hacking!

<Callout title='From Existing Codebase?'>

    You can follow the [Manual Installation](/docs/ui/manual-installation) guide to get started.

</Callout>

### Enjoy!

Create your first MDX file in the docs folder.

```mdx title="content/docs/index.mdx"
---
title: Hello World
---

## Yo what's up
```

Run the app in development mode and see http://localhost:3000/docs.

```package-install
npm run dev
```

## Explore

In the project, you can see:

- `lib/source.ts`: Code for content source adapter, Fumadocs needs [`loader()`](/docs/headless/source-api) to interact with your content source.
- `app/layout.config.tsx`: Shared options for layouts, optional but preferred to keep.
- `app/(home)`: The route group for your landing page and other pages.
- `app/docs`: The documentation layout and pages.
- `app/api/search/route.ts`: The Route Handler for search.

### Customise Content

Content source handles all your content, like compiling Markdown files, and validating frontmatter.

- **Fumadocs MDX:** Read the [Introduction](/docs/mdx) to learn how it handles your content,
  and customise different options like frontmatter schema. A `source.config.ts` config file has been included.

- **Custom Source:** Fumadocs is not Markdown-exclusive. For other sources like Sanity, you can [build a custom content source](/docs/headless/custom-source).

### Customise Sidebar

Navigation elements like sidebar take a [Page Tree](/docs/headless/page-tree) to render navigation links, it's a tree that describes all available pages and folders.

Normally, the sidebar items (formally page tree) are generated from your file structure.
You can learn how to customise the page tree from:

### Writing Content

Despite from supported syntax of MDX, Fumadocs has some additional features for authoring content too.
You can refer to:

  />
</Cards>

### Customise UI

Since the design system is built on Tailwind CSS, you can [customise colors with CSS Variables](/docs/ui/theme#colors).

Fumadocs UI offers pre-styled layouts and UI components, you can customise components with exposed props like `style` and `className`.
We also provided many options to customise layouts ([See Available Options](/docs/ui/layouts)).

If none of them suits you, Fumadocs CLI is a way to install Fumadocs UI components and layouts to your codebase, similar to Shadcn UI. Allowing you to fully customise with code:

```package-install
@fumadocs/cli --save-dev
```

```bash
pnpm fumadocs add
```
